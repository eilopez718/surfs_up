# Surf's up


## Overview of Analysis: 

	The purpose of the analysis was to help W. Avy determin if and Ice Cream and Surf Shop was a viable year-round
  business on the island of Oahu.  We did this by examining the recorded temperatures in June and December.


## Results:

	1. The average temperature in June on Oahu is 74.9 degrees as opposed to is 71.0 degrees in December, a difference of about 4 degrees.
  
	2. The central 50% of observations for both months is within a range of about 4-5 degrees, suggesting very stable temperatures at
  opposite ends of the year.
	
	3. Despite the fairly small differences in the temperature data between the two months, the low observed in December was 8 degrees 
  lower than the low observed in June.
  
  ## Summary:
  
  Initial analysis of the June and December temperature data suggest relatively stable temperatures year round on Oahu.  Additional 
  analyses that could be performed with the data would be:
     
      i. View precipitation data alongside the temperature data, which would have an impact on surfing traffic.
      
      ii. Perform a temperature/precip trends for the entire year.  Given Hawaii's tropical climate, temperature would seem to be less of an 
      indicator of future business than precipitation.  Viewing both factors throughout the year might lend more insight.
